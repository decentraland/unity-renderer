# UI Components Library

The **UI Components Library** is a single source of truth for all the styled components we use on all our UI screens. The main advantages of having this library are:

- Keep the visual coherency in all our UIs.
- Improve the implementation times for new UIs.
- Minimize the maintenance of the already existing UI.
