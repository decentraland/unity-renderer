 * Score deduced by latency, equivalent to users. This responds to the following formula: m * (e ^ (x / d) - 1)
 * Where m is the multiplier, e is Euler's number, x is the latency and d is the exponencialDivisor.
 * See here for a visualization of the formula: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zflj2ik6pl
 * By default, these values are 60 for the multiplier, and 700 for the divisor, resulting, for example, in the following values:
 *
 * | latency | deduction |
 * | ------- | --------- |
 * | 500     | 62        |
 * | 750     | 115       |

 * | 1750    | 670       |
 * | 2000    | 984       |
 *
 * If a maxDeduction is provided, then no more than that number of users will be deduced from the score.
